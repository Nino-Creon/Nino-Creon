## 📌 About Me  
I'm a nephrologist, and PhD student in biostatistics and epidemiology at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. I work in the **[Carrero Group](https://ki.se/en/research/research-areas-centres-and-networks/research-groups/cardio-renal-epidemiology-juan-jesus-carreros-research-group)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Juan J. Carrero](https://ki.se/en/people/juan-jesus-carrero)**, **[Dr. Edouard L. Fu](https://edouard-fu.github.io/)** (from **[Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/en/)**), **[Prof. Arvid Sjölander](https://ki.se/en/people/arvid-sjolander#about-me)** and **[Dr. Anne-Laure Faucon](https://ki.se/en/people/annelaure-faucon)**. My work involves large-scale register and laboratory data as well as causal inference methods.

## 🔬 Research interests
- Equity and variability in kidney outcomes and care
- Evaluating and personalizing treatment strategies in kidney disease
- Generalizability of cardio-renal treatment effects

## 🔧 Methodological interests
- Inverse probability weighting and other g-methods
- Target trial emulation of dynamic treatment strategies
- Causal machine learning

## 🚀 Key Projects
- **Albuminuria care gaps in kidney disease**  
  Investigating disparities in monitoring and treatment in large-scale register and laboratory data.  
  🔗 Coming soon
- **Measured versus estimated glomerular filtration rate and risk of adverse outcomes**  
  Comparing measured and estimated GFR to understand how they relate to kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality.  
  🔗 Coming soon
- **Population-based eGFR distributions and early identification of chronic kidney disease**  
  Developing a framework using population-specific eGFR distributions to identify individuals at high risk of kidney failure or death.  
  🔗 Coming soon
